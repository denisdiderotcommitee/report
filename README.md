Committee calls for Sanctions on Russian Pay-TV Satellite Platforms Trikolor and NTV+, Petition created

​

Eutelsat 36°E could allow alternative Western channels access to 25-30% of Russian homes

Paris -  5 April 2022

 

The Denis Diderot Committee announced today the creation of an online petition (link), which calls upon the European Union and EUTELSAT IGO to sanction  transmission of two major Russian platforms pay-TV platforms, NTV Plus and Trikolor using their positions on  the European Eutelsat satellites.

​

Since the beginning of March, in the context of the war in Ukraine and new restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by the Russian government, two Russian platforms, NTV Plus (part of the Gazprom Media Holding) and Trikolor, have excluded from their line-up all the foreign news channels they were still proposing in February: BBC World, CNN, Deutsche Welle (DW), Euronews (in Russian), France 24, NHK World, RAiNews 24 TV5 Monde .

​

These two pay-TV packages operate on satellites at 36°E owned by the company of French law Eutelsat S.A. (ISIN:FR0010221234; Ticker: ETL) and under the rules of the Convention of the intergovernmental organisation Eutelsat IGO.

​

It is paradoxical and inadmissible that European satellites are used for the sole broadcasting of Russian channels, which only propagate the official state propaganda of the Kremlin and that Western news channels are banned from an infrastructure managed by a company under French law and in the framework of an intergovernmental convention!

​

Eutelsat’s 36°E is a strategic satellite position in Russia from where 25-30% of Russians households receive their main television signal.  The removal of Trikolor and NTV+ from these satellites would allow for the potential uplink of international news channels, as well as independent Russian language, informative channels. 

​

“The two Russian operators claim that the switch-off of the international news channels was at the initiative of the broadcasters, which is clearly untrue. The EU and EUTELSAT IGO cannot accept this censorship using European satellite capacities and neither the continued transmission on Eutelsat transponders of RT News, the Kremlin war propaganda channel, banned by an EU decision one month ago.  We want Eutelsat’s 36°E to become a wellspring of independent news for the Russian people, so that Russian citizens  will have the information needed to act” says Denis Diderot Committee coordinator, Dr. Andre Lange.

​

“We believe in the fundamental goodness of the Russian people.  However, because of the complete dominance of the Kremlin’s media, ordinary Russians do not even know the horrors that are now perpetrated in their name upon the Ukrainian people.  It is imperative that people of Russia see the truth as to what is happening in Ukraine.  69% of Russians rely upon television for their main source of news, according to TASS.  With these sanctions we could create real change in the crucial television space,” says Committee member, Jim Phillipoff.

​

The petition is already signed by various personalities in the field of communication and media as well as by all Members of the National Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting of Ukraine. (Complete list here)
